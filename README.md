# Radiation efficiency for point excited simply supported plates

Computes the radiation efficiency of a simply supported baffled plate given a point harmonic excitation. The sound power, amplitude velocity and the radiation modes are plotted to understand this parameter.

Uses the elementary radiators approach. The radiation modes come from the eigen analysis of the acoustical radiation resistance matrix [R] and the Direct Calculation Method (DCM)
